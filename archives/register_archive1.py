    # ToDo: test results show that:
    #  1. FLIRT takes ~2 minutes to complete. Will explore faster rigid registration strategies. It would be
    #  great if we can figure out what registration strategy Visage uses, because that takes ~10 seconds.
    #  2. the registered image is a bit blurrier than the original image. Will explore better resampling strategies
    #  such as B-spline interpolation.
